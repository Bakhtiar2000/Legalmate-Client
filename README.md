# Legalmate - Lawyer-Client Communication Platform

Legalmate is a platform designed to facilitate seamless communication between lawyers and clients. The platform allows clients to post legal cases, browse lawyer profiles, and connect with lawyers after payment. Lawyers can find relevant cases, connect with clients post-payment, and manage their profiles. Admins have access to manage all aspects of the platform, including lawyers, clients, cases, reviews, and transaction history.
